description: "28 Linear issues auto-generated by game-project-manager agent from PRD - Complete pipeline for vampire survivors-like game development"
---


## Overview

`game-project-manager` agent analyzed vampire survivors-like Unity game PRD and auto-generated 28 tasks in Linear

Systematically broke down entire project pipeline from core mechanics to Steam deployment in sequential order

## Generated Task Structure

### Core Gameplay (0XD-13 ~ 0XD-18)
- **Player Character Controller** (0XD-13): 8-directional movement and Input System
- **Object Pooling System** (0XD-14): Core infrastructure for performance optimization
- **Projectile Weapon System** (0XD-15): Auto-fire mechanics
- **Enemy AI and Tracking** (0XD-16): Player chase behavior patterns
- **Enemy Spawning System** (0XD-17): Including difficulty scaling
- **XP and Level-Up System** (0XD-18): Growth mechanics

### Data Architecture and Expansion (0XD-19 ~ 0XD-23)
- **ScriptableObject Data Structure** (0XD-19): Weapon/enemy/upgrade stat management
- **Upgrade Selection UI** (0XD-20): Present 3 options on level-up
- **Diverse Weapon Types** (0XD-21): 6+ weapon types implementation
- **Diverse Enemy Types** (0XD-22): 4+ enemy types implementation
- **Upgrade Database** (0XD-23): Upgrade pool and application system

### Systems and Feedback (0XD-24 ~ 0XD-27)
- **Game State Management** (0XD-24): Game over conditions and timer
- **Particle Effects System** (0XD-25): Visual feedback
- **Screen Shake and Damage Numbers** (0XD-26): Impact enhancement
- **Audio System** (0XD-27): SFX and background music

### UI and Menus (0XD-28 ~ 0XD-31)
- **HUD Interface** (0XD-28): HP, XP, timer, kill count
- **Main Menu** (0XD-29): Start, settings, exit
- **Pause Menu** (0XD-30): Continue, restart, return to main
- **Game Over Screen** (0XD-31): Statistics and restart options

### Advanced Features (0XD-32 ~ 0XD-34)
- **Weapon Evolution System** (0XD-32): Enhancement on specific conditions
- **Boss and Elite Enemies** (0XD-33): Challenge elements
- **Steam Integration** (0XD-34): Achievements, leaderboards, cloud saves

### Environment and Optimization (0XD-35 ~ 0XD-37)
- **Arena Environment** (0XD-35): Boundaries and visual elements
- **Performance Optimization** (0XD-36): Profiling and bottleneck removal
- **Balance Tuning** (0XD-37): Difficulty scaling tuning

### Deployment and QA (0XD-38 ~ 0XD-40)
- **Settings Persistence** (0XD-38): PlayerPrefs, graphics options
- **Steam Build Configuration** (0XD-39): Build pipeline setup
- **Final QA and Bug Fixing** (0XD-40): Pre-launch verification

## Agent Workflow

**Input**: PRD document (vampire survivors-like game design)

**Processing**:
1. Task Master AI parses PRD (`parse-prd`)
2. Break down by game development pipeline stages
3. Set dependencies for each task
4. Create issues via Linear API

**Result**:
- 28 structured tasks
- Clear execution order (dependency-based)
- Core mechanics → UI → advanced features → deployment sequence

## Significance

Real-world example of **AI-based project management**

Automated manual work of breaking down 28 tasks and setting dependencies

Write PRD only to auto-generate executable backlog

Systematic breakdown with game development domain knowledge (pooling → weapon → enemy → spawn sequence, etc.)

## Next Steps

Execute each task with TDD workflow (`autopilot-start`)

Implementation with Task Master's RED-GREEN-COMMIT cycle

Phased development from Unity components to Steam integration
