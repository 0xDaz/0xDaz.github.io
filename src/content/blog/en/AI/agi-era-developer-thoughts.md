## 3 Years of Change and Fear

About 3 years since ChatGPT launched in November 2022. As a developer using AI daily, the AI growth witnessed during this period goes beyond amazement and wonder - it's **close to fear**

Personally convinced that within 1 year, AI will surpass most of my current business capabilities. Not exaggeration - a realistic scenario given current development pace

## Changing Economic Structure

Interestingly, many Silicon Valley leaders are seriously discussing transition to Universal Basic Income. This isn't just social welfare policy - it means a shift to an **eerie economic structure** where most labor is replaced by AI

Big tech's race to develop AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is literally a **winner-takes-all** game, no different from challenging divine territory. Yet public attention remains far too low compared to the significance of this change
